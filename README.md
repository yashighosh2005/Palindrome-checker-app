# UC1: Application Entry & Welcome Message

### Goal: 
Display a welcome message and app details at startup.
### Actor: 

User

### Flow:

● Program starts.

● JVM invokes the main() method.

● Application name is displayed.

● Application version is displayed.

● Program continues to next use case or exits.

### Key Concepts used in UC1:

● Class – Acts as a container for the Palindrome Checker application logic.

● Main Method – Entry point of the Java application with the signature
public static void main(String[] args).

● Static Keyword – Allows the JVM to invoke the main() method without creating an
object.

● Console Output – System.out.println() is used to display messages on the
console.

● Application Flow Control – Defines the startup behavior before palindrome processing
begins.

# UC2: Print a Hardcoded Palindrome Result

### Goal: 
Display whether a hardcoded string is a palindrome.

### Actor: 
User
### Flow:

1. Program starts
2. Hardcoded string is checked
3. Result is printed
4. Program exits
   
### Key Concepts used in UC2:

● Class – In Java, even the simplest program must be written inside a class, as a class
   acts as a container to hold program logic.
   
● Main Method – Entry point of the Java application with the signature
   public static void main(String[] args).
   
● Static Keyword – Allows the JVM to invoke the main() method without creating an
   object of the class.
   
● String – A built-in Java class used to store and manipulate textual data. Here, it stores
   the word to be checked for a palindrome.
   
● String Literal – Text enclosed within double quotes ("madam"), stored in the String
   constant pool.
   
● Conditional Statement (if-else) – Used to evaluate whether the given string satisfies
   the palindrome condition.
   
● Console Output – System.out.println() is used to display the result on the
   console.

# UC3: Palindrome Check Using String Reverse
### Goal: 
Check whether a string is a palindrome by reversing it.
### Flow:
1. Reverse string using loop
2. Compare original and reversed
3. Display result
### Key Concepts used in UC3:
● Loop (for loop) – Used to iterate through the characters of the string in reverse order.
   
● String Immutability – In Java, String objects are immutable; every modification creates
   a new String object.
   
● String Concatenation (+) – Used to build the reversed string character by character
   (introduced here to later discuss drawbacks).
   
● equals() Method – Used to compare the actual content of two String objects instead of
   memory references

# UC4: Character Array Based Palindrome Check
### Goal: 
Convert string to character array and compare characters.
### Flow:
1. Convert string to char[]
2. Use two-pointer approach
3. Compare start & end characters
### Key Concepts used in UC4:
   
● Character Array (char[]) – A primitive array used to store individual characters of a
   string for index-based access.
   
● Array Indexing – Accessing elements using index positions starting from 0.
   
● Two-Pointer Technique – One pointer starts from the beginning and the other from the
   end, reducing unnecessary comparisons.
   
● Time Complexity Awareness – Demonstrates efficient comparison without creating
   extra objects.

# UC5: Stack-Based Palindrome Checker
### Goal: 
Use stack to reverse characters and validate palindrome.
### Flow:
1. Push characters into stack
2. Pop and compare
3. Print result
   
### Key Concepts used in UC5:
   
● Stack – A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
   
● Push Operation – Used to insert characters into the stack.
   
● Pop Operation – Used to remove characters from the stack in reverse order.
   
● Reversal Logic – Stack naturally reverses the order of elements, making it suitable for
   palindrome validation

# UC6: Queue + Stack Based Palindrome Check
### Goal: 
Demonstrate FIFO vs LIFO using Queue and Stack.
### Flow:
1. Enqueue characters
2. Push characters to stack
3. Compare dequeue vs pop
   
### Key Concepts used in UC6:
   
● Queue – A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
   
● Enqueue & Dequeue Operations – Used to insert and remove elements from the
   queue.

● Stack vs Queue – Demonstrates the behavioral difference between LIFO and FIFO
   structures.

● Logical Comparison – Matching dequeue (queue) output with pop (stack) output to
   validate palindrome logic.

# UC7: Deque-Based Optimized Palindrome Checker
### Goal: 
Use Deque to compare front and rear elements.
### Flow:
1. Insert characters into deque
2. Remove first & last
3. Compare until empty
   
### Key Concepts used in UC7:
   
● Deque (Double Ended Queue) – A data structure that allows insertion and deletion
   from both front and rear ends.
   
● Front and Rear Access – Enables direct comparison of first and last characters.
   
● Optimized Data Handling – Eliminates the need for separate reversal data structures.

# UC8: Linked List Based Palindrome Checker
### Goal: 
Check palindrome using singly linked list.
### Flow:
- Convert string to linked list

- Reverse second half

- Compare halves
### Key Concepts used in UC8:
- Singly Linked List – A dynamic data structure where elements are connected using node references.
- Node Traversal – Sequential access to elements using next references.
- Fast and Slow Pointer Technique – Used to find the middle of the linked list efficiently.
- In-Place Reversal – Reverses the second half of the list without extra memory.

# UC9: Recursive Palindrome Checker
### Goal: 
Check palindrome using recursion.
### Flow:
- Recursive call compares start & end
- Base condition exits recursion

### Key Concepts used in UC9:
- Recursion – A technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
- Base Condition – Prevents infinite recursion and terminates the recursive calls.
- Call Stack – Memory structure used to manage method calls during recursion.
